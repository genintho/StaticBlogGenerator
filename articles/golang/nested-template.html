<p>Here is snippet of code showing how to do nested template in Golang, with templates being stored in multiple files</p>
<p>While being very simple, it took me a bit of trial as the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">documentation</a> does not talk about multifile</p>
<p>I store the templates in a global for performance thanks to the guide <a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/#tmp_10">"Writing Web applications"</a></p>
<p>I use go1.2</p>
