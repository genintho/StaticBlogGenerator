    I just released my first public Chrome Extension: unusedCSS.
    You can download it on the <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unusedcss/dokggbghedajooenkgjbamikfgnngeik>Chrome WebStore</a>.
<p>
    This extension is a developper tools aiming at improving the detection of 
    unused CSS rules in JavaScript heavy WebApp.
</p>
<p>
    I know that tools doing that are already existing. But these tools are not
    targeting the same kind of site. They target content website where the page
    is generated on the server and the user is navigating from page to page.
</p>
<p>
    But in the case of WebApp, the user can use a single page application, with no navigation and with the page being construct by JavaScript.
    In this case, these tools, which are doing a static inspection are useless.
</p>
<p>
    This extension is reaction to navigation event and DOM modification event and is trying to react to these event to update the list of used selector.
</p>
<p>
    It is working quite well, with good performance, but some love needs to be apply: I need a logo, improve the results, try to do a crawling option, move the tool in the developer tools, etc
</p>

    The source are available on <a href=https://github.com/genintho/unusedCSS>Github</a>, let me know if you have ideas to improve it, or found a bug.
