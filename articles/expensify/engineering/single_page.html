    One of the most important project I have been working on at Expensify has been the creation of a
    JavaScript framework to convert Expensify into a single page application.
</p>

<p>
    This project started in December 2011 as an experiment to try to speed up the website. I started to work on the
    "Dashboard" and the "Reports" page to see if it was possible to go from one to the other without reloading the page.
    Of course it is "technically" possible but the goal was more to see how difficult it was going to be and what kind
    of performance improvement we could get.
</p>

<p>
    The results were amazing. Going to from one page to the other was almost instant. The contrast with the navigation to
    "none single page" pages was insane: we are talking about an 800+% improvement. Refactoring the Website to transform
    it into a full single page Web Application was the only way to go to get amazing performance. Our backend will just
    become an API which will be consumed by our different front-end / application / integration.
</p>

<p>
    JavaScript Application are a very trendy subject. A lots of tools, framework, discussion about them are popping
    everywhere. We started the conversion of our site at the very beginning of this wave but we did not ride it for
    multiple reasons.
</p>
<p>
    Single Page App are very difficult. So many choice to do. Which framework? Which paradigm? Which templating engine?
    Wdiget heavy or DOM centric? pushState? Progressive enhancement or graceful degradation? history API? Which library?
    Which build process? And so on. Hopefully some tools and pattern start to become "standard" like jQuery became kind
    standart. But when we started it was not the case.
</p>

<p>
    So what are we using? We are using jQuery, underscore and that's almost it. We build our own framework, from the
    ground up. And it is an awesome framework. I know it sounds crazy, that we are reinventing the wheel. Part of that
    is completly true. And to be honest I was against this idea, I would have rather use Backbone. But in the end it was
    a good decision for multiple reason.
</p>

<p>
    I am happy to see that this project is almost done. Few pages need to be converted, and few tweaks needs to be done
    to offer the full Expensify experience to customers without any page reload. After that, we will start an other round
    of improvements on the performance side: reducing the load time of the application, improving our caching strategies and
    improving our DOM manipulations.
