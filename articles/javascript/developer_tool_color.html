<p>
    While debugging an issue the other day, I was logging in the JavaScript console the ID of an element.
    I quickly noticed that the color being used was not always the same.
</p>

<div class=image>
    <img
            src="/images/javascript/chrome_tool_blue_black.png"
            alt="Chrome developer tools log in color based on the type of variable"
            title="Chrome developer tools log in color based on the type of variable"
            />
    <p>The Chrome developer tools log number in blue and string in black.</p>
</div>
