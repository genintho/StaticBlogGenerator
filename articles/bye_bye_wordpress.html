    Dear Wordpress, it is time for me to move away from you. It is has been a good and long ride but I have to go
    to some other solution.
</p>
<p>
    But do not worry, we are still going to be friend. I really like you. You are free, easy to setup, easy to use,
    extremely powerful and we can do everything we want with you. That's just awesome.
</p>
<p>
    But that's not for anymore, or to be more precise, not for my blog. You are an amazing products for most of the
    people, but you are too fat for this blog.
</p>
<p>
    I know that I am picky, but I am a developper, so my need are not the need of most people.
<ul>
    <li>I know how to write HTML and CSS so the preview/HTML editor is not necessary</li>
    <li>I want to position my image precisely, and in a different way for each post so the "media" feature is not necessary</li>
    <li>I don't want to customize it, I just want to write and control the visual. So no need for plugins.</li>
    <li>It should allow me to write post specific JavaScript.</li>
    <li>It should allow any kind of markup: I am the one in control.</li>
    <li>The editor you use should display only the text, and be able to live render it.</li>
    <li>It should not have 300 options that I can barely understand.</li>
    <li>It should be amazingly fast to load and naviguate.</li>
    <li>It should require no update.</li>
    <li>It does not need an ACL system.</li>
    <li>It should not require me to learn a new language.</li>
    <li>It should be secure.</li>
    <li>It should be easy to backup</li>
    <li>It should be easy to deploy</li>
    <li>It should be cheap to host and easy to scale ( like I am going to need it ).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    It should be a static web site.
</p>
<p>
    Well, it is a <a href="https://github.com/genintho/StaticBlogGenerator" title="My custom blog generator">little more than that</a>.
